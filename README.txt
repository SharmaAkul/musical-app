I have created this project under the Android FoundationI Nano-Degree.This is the Layout of Musical App which have 4 main activities as follows-:
1.Now Playing
2.Play List
3.Songs/Music
4.Seettings.

The goal is to design and create the structure of a Music app which would allow a user to play audio files. There are many music player apps, and they make a wide variety of design 
choices. It will be your job to decide what kind of music app your structure would turn into and build out that structure using intents. 

I have used OnClickListeners and explicit Intents to link between different activities within our own app.
